# something 
it was supposed to be an playground for classes but i ended up making something<br>
it's a cmd program for registering workers<br>
i was basically "*freestyling*" what i was doing - had no idea of what i wanted to do ðŸ˜… just wanted to mess with classes - so i added options for name and age<br>
and, based on a [save/load](https://github.com/Jwsxs/save_load_cs) file i've made, you can export it to a .txt<br>

## how to use
bnasically just type -h it'll help you figure it out
